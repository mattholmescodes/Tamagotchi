# Tamagotchi App!

In this app you will be tested in keeping your pet alive.. however there is a catch.

## You can only look after your pet in the CLI!!

Features include naming, feeding and walking your pet whilst it ages.
 
 - If your pet's fitness reaches 0, it will die.
 - If your pet's hunger reaches 10, it will die.

Your pet will automatically die when it reaches 30 - Can you keep it alive for that long?
